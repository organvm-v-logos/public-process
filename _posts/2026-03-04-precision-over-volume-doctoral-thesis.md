# Precision Over Volume: A Doctoral Thesis

**Full title:** *Precision Over Volume: A Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis Framework for Optimal Career Application Pipeline Management*

This doctoral thesis presents the theoretical foundations, mathematical proofs, and empirical analysis behind the precision pipeline --- a production system for career application management that evolved from a volume-optimized tracker into a precision-optimized decision engine.

## Key Contributions

- **Six-tradition theoretical integration:** Multi-criteria decision analysis, social network theory, optimal stopping theory, portfolio optimization, information theory, and persuasion science --- unified for the first time in career pipeline literature
- **Formal mathematical proofs:** WSM boundedness, network proximity optimality, portfolio concentration theorems, and more
- **Systematic competitive analysis:** The precision pipeline compared against all existing alternatives
- **Design science methodology:** Mixed-methods approach following Hevner et al. (2004) guidelines

## Read the Full Dissertation
