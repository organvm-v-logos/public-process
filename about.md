# About Public Process

## What Is ORGAN-V?

Public Process is the public-facing essay series of **organvm** — an eight-organ creative-institutional system that coordinates approximately 80 GitHub repositories across 8 GitHub organizations. ORGAN-V (Logos) is the discourse layer: the place where the system explains itself, documents its decisions, examines its failures, and builds in public.

The word *logos* carries deliberate weight. In its Greek origins, logos means not just "word" but "reason" — the principle of order and intelligibility underlying a system. ORGAN-V does not merely describe what the organvm system does. It articulates *why* it is structured as it is, *how* decisions are made, and *what* those decisions mean for creative practice, institutional design, and the relationship between human direction and AI-generated volume.

Every essay published here is simultaneously a piece of critical writing and a portfolio artifact. The audience includes grant reviewers, hiring managers, collaborators, and anyone interested in how a single practitioner can sustain a complex creative infrastructure using modern tooling and disciplined governance.

## The Eight-Organ Model

The organvm system divides creative-institutional work into eight specialized organs, each with its own GitHub organization, repositories, and domain of responsibility. The organs are named using Greek ontological suffixes that describe their function.

**[ORGAN I — Theoria](https://github.com/organvm-i-theoria)** (Theory): The epistemological foundation. Recursive engines, ontological frameworks, and the theoretical infrastructure that feeds every other organ. Repositories here deal with knowledge architecture, epistemic tuning, and formal models of creative recursion. Flagship: `recursive-engine`.

**[ORGAN II — Poiesis](https://github.com/organvm-ii-poiesis)** (Art): The generative and performative layer. Generative music, choreographic interfaces, interactive theatre, game design, and experiential art. This organ transforms theoretical frameworks into artistic output. Flagships: `metasystem-master`, `a-mavs-olevm`.

**[ORGAN III — Ergon](https://github.com/organvm-iii-ergon)** (Commerce): Products and services. SaaS platforms, B2B tools, B2C applications, and revenue-generating projects. Commerce is not separate from creative practice here — it is one of its organs. Flagship: `public-record-data-scrapper`.

**[ORGAN IV — Taxis](https://github.com/organvm-iv-taxis)** (Orchestration): Governance, routing, and coordination. The organ that manages how the other organs interact, enforces dependency rules (no back-edges: I flows to II flows to III, never the reverse), and maintains the system constitution. Flagships: `orchestration-start-here`, `agentic-titan`.

**[ORGAN V — Logos](https://github.com/organvm-v-logos)** (Public Process): You are here. Essays, methodology, and the public narrative of building an eight-organ system. This organ treats process documentation as a first-class creative deliverable.

**[ORGAN VI — Koinonia](https://github.com/organvm-vi-koinonia)** (Community): Salons, reading groups, and community infrastructure. The organ responsible for creating spaces where others can engage with the system's ideas, contribute, and build their own practices.

**[ORGAN VII — Kerygma](https://github.com/organvm-vii-kerygma)** (Marketing): POSSE distribution, announcements, and public communication. Kerygma — "proclamation" — handles how the system presents itself to external audiences across platforms.

**[Meta — organvm](https://github.com/meta-organvm)** (Umbrella): The meta-organization that contains the corpus, the constitution, and the registry that serves as single source of truth for all repositories across all organs. Flagship: `organvm-corpvs-testamentvm`.

## Dependency Architecture

The organs are not peers — they form a directed acyclic graph. Theory (I) feeds Art (II) feeds Commerce (III). Orchestration (IV) governs all. Logos (V), Koinonia (VI), and Kerygma (VII) are lateral organs that draw from the system but do not create upstream dependencies. This unidirectional flow is enforced as a constitutional invariant: ORGAN-III cannot depend on ORGAN-II internals, and ORGAN-II cannot reach back into ORGAN-I's decision architecture. The constraint prevents the kind of circular dependency that collapses complex systems into ungovernable tangles.

## The Author

The organvm system is designed and maintained by a creative technologist and AI engineer operating under the handle **@4444J99**. The system reflects five years of autonomous creative practice — building infrastructure that sustains artistic work without institutional employment, grants, or external funding (though those are welcomed).

The methodology is the **AI-conductor model**: AI generates volume, the human directs strategy and ensures accuracy. This is not "AI wrote everything" — it is a specific workflow with defined roles, quality gates, and economics. The planning corpus alone exceeds 270,000 words. The human contribution is the decision architecture, the governance model, the priority framework, and the editorial judgment that distinguishes portfolio-quality documentation from generic boilerplate.
