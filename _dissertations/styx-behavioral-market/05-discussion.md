# Chapter 5: Discussion

This chapter interprets the formal results established in Chapter 4 in light of the theoretical foundations developed in Chapter 2, addressing each of the five research questions in turn. The discussion moves from interpretation of individual theorems to a synthetic evaluation of the Styx framework as a whole, then confronts the limitations of this work and identifies productive directions for future research. Throughout, the emphasis is on what the formal results mean for the design, deployment, and regulation of financially-staked behavioral commitment systems --- a class of interventions that has, until now, lacked rigorous theoretical grounding.

## 5.1 RQ1: Loss Aversion as Commitment Engine

**RQ1: How can loss aversion ($\lambda = 1.955$) be operationalized as a calibrated penalty coefficient in a financially-staked behavioral commitment system?**

### 5.1.1 From Prospect Theory to Platform Architecture

The central insight motivating the Styx design is that loss aversion, first identified by Kahneman and Tversky (1979) and refined by Tversky and Kahneman (1992), is not merely a cognitive bias to be catalogued but a behavioral force that can be harnessed as an engineering parameter. The loss aversion coefficient $\lambda = 1.955$ --- drawn from the most recent large-scale cross-cultural replication (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979; Tversky & Kahneman, 1992) --- quantifies the asymmetry between the psychological weight of losses and equivalent gains. In Styx, this coefficient is operationalized directly: when a user stakes amount $\sigma$, the perceived psychological cost of forfeiting that stake is approximately $\lambda \cdot \sigma \approx 1.955\sigma$. The stake amount itself is the design variable; the loss aversion coefficient transforms it into a subjective deterrent whose magnitude is nearly double the nominal financial exposure.

This operationalization represents a departure from how loss aversion has been applied in prior commitment device platforms. Existing systems have employed financial stakes informally, treating the relationship between stake magnitude and behavioral deterrence as a matter of intuition or user preference. DietBet, for example, uses fixed pool structures ($30 entry) with a 4% weight loss target over four weeks (DietBet, 2026); the stake amount is determined by the pool structure rather than by any principled calibration against the user's psychological response to potential loss. HealthyWage adopts a prize-based gain framing, where users "bet" on their weight loss with the prospect of winning up to $10,000 (HealthyWage, 2026); while the amounts are substantial, the motivational lever is anticipated gain rather than fear of loss, which prospect theory predicts to be approximately half as powerful per dollar. Beeminder uses "commitment contracts" with escalating pledge amounts (Beeminder, 2026) --- an intuitively sound approach, but one that lacks formal connection to the empirical loss aversion literature. StickK, conceived by behavioral economists Ian Ayres and Dean Karlan at Yale, implements commitment contracts with optional financial stakes directed to anti-charities (Bryan, Karlan & Nelson, 2010), yet provides no formal safety bounds and no mechanism for verifying compliance beyond self-reporting or a single designated referee.

What distinguishes Styx from all four competitors is the explicit, formal link between the prospect-theoretic coefficient and the platform's penalty architecture. The stake amount is not a design afterthought; it is a controlled variable in a system whose penalty ratios are calibrated against the empirically measured strength of loss aversion.

### 5.1.2 The Tier System as Graduated Exposure

Rather than permitting arbitrary stake amounts, Styx implements a five-tier system that gates maximum stake exposure to the user's demonstrated behavioral history, as formalized in the integrity score function *IS*(*u*) (Definition D3, Section 3.3). The tier thresholds --- RESTRICTED_MODE (*IS* < 20, max stake $0), TIER_1_MICRO_STAKES (*IS* < 50, max $20), TIER_2_STANDARD (*IS* < 100, max $100), TIER_3_HIGH_ROLLER (*IS* < 500, max $1,000), and TIER_4_WHALE_VAULTS (*IS* $\geq$ 500, unlimited) --- serve two purposes simultaneously.

First, the tier system functions as a behavioral ramp, consistent with the transtheoretical model of behavior change (Prochaska & DiClemente, 1983; Prochaska & Velicer, 1997). New users begin at TIER_1_MICRO_STAKES with a maximum exposure of $20 --- sufficient, when amplified by $\lambda = 1.955$, to produce a perceived loss magnitude of approximately $39.10. This is large enough to create meaningful deterrence for small behavioral commitments (a week of gym attendance, three days without contacting an ex-partner) without exposing a novice user to catastrophic financial risk. As the user accumulates completed contracts and their integrity score rises, they gain access to progressively higher stake ceilings, mirroring the "successive approximation" principle in contingency management (Stitzer & Petry, 2018).

Second, the tier system implements a form of risk management that addresses the concern raised by Gneezy and Rustichini (2000) regarding the potentially counterproductive effects of small financial incentives. Their seminal finding --- that introducing a small fine for late daycare pickups actually increased tardiness by transforming a social obligation into a market transaction --- implies that stakes must be large enough to avoid the "crowding-out zone" where financial incentives are too small to deter but large enough to displace intrinsic motivation. The Styx tier system addresses this by ensuring that even the minimum functional stake ($20 at TIER_1) produces a perceived loss ($\sim$39) that exceeds the threshold at which financial penalties become salient deterrents. This is further reinforced by the $5 onboarding bonus (*B*$_{onboard}$), which uses the endowment effect (Thaler, 1999) to establish an initial reference point that the user is psychologically unwilling to abandon.

### 5.1.3 Friction Reducers and Temporal Safeguards

The operationalization of loss aversion requires not only calibrated penalties but also carefully designed temporal safeguards to prevent the system from becoming either too rigid or too permissive. Styx implements three friction-reduction mechanisms: grace days (2 per month, *g*$_{max}$), a cool-off period (7 days, $\tau_{cool}$), and the onboarding bonus.

Grace days address a well-documented challenge in habit formation research: the asymmetry between the difficulty of perfect compliance and the motivational collapse that follows a single failure. Lally et al. (2010) found that missing a single day of habit practice does not significantly affect long-term habit formation, but the psychological impact of "breaking the streak" can trigger a cascade of abandonment --- what Marlatt and Donovan (2005) termed the "abstinence violation effect" in addiction research. By permitting two grace days per month without penalty, Styx decouples occasional lapses from perceived failure, maintaining the user's engagement without undermining the credibility of the stake.

The 7-day cool-off period ($\tau_{cool}$) following a contract failure addresses the temporal dimension of loss aversion. Loewenstein and Prelec (1992) demonstrated that emotional responses to losses are temporally concentrated, peaking immediately after the loss event and decaying over subsequent days. The cool-off period prevents users from making retaliatory or impulsive restaking decisions --- what the breakup psychology literature identifies as the "revenge staking" vulnerability window (see Section 5.4 below) --- during the period of maximum emotional dysregulation. This is particularly critical for Recovery oath category contracts, where the dissolution of a romantic relationship triggers neurobiological responses that mirror clinical substance withdrawal in intensity and duration (Attachment Project, 2026; Fisher et al., 2010).

### 5.1.4 The Asymmetric Incentive Property

The most technically significant contribution to RQ1 is the asymmetric incentive property established in Theorem T3 (Section 4.3). The integrity score formula penalizes fraud at $\beta_f = 15$ points and failed oaths at $\beta_s = 20$ points, while rewarding completed oaths at only $\beta_c = 5$ points. The resulting penalty-to-reward ratios are:

$$\frac{\beta_f}{\beta_c} = \frac{15}{5} = 3 \qquad \frac{\beta_s}{\beta_c} = \frac{20}{5} = 4$$

Both ratios exceed $\lambda = 1.955$, meaning that the system's structural penalties for negative outcomes exceed the loss aversion threshold. This is a deliberate over-calibration: even a user who is perfectly loss-averse (i.e., whose subjective weighting of losses matches the population mean) will perceive the system as disproportionately punitive for failures relative to its rewards for successes. The rationale is that behavioral commitment systems must overcome not only loss aversion but also optimism bias (Ariely, 2008) and present bias (O'Donoghue & Rabin, 1999), both of which systematically lead users to underestimate the probability and severity of future failures.

This design choice has a further consequence identified in Theorem T3: the integrity score is strictly monotonically increasing for users whose success rate exceeds the breakeven ratio $\frac{\beta_s}{\beta_c + \beta_s} = \frac{20}{25} = 0.8$. Users who succeed on more than 80% of their contracts will, in expectation, accumulate integrity score indefinitely, gaining access to higher tiers and larger stake amounts. Users who fail more than 20% of the time will, in expectation, see their integrity score decay toward the RESTRICTED_MODE floor, progressively limiting their exposure. The system thus exhibits a self-reinforcing selection dynamic: it retains and empowers users who demonstrate sustained behavioral success while gently constraining those who do not.

### 5.1.5 Comparative Assessment

To summarize the comparative positioning: Styx is, to the knowledge of this research, the first behavioral commitment platform to combine (a) explicit operationalization of the prospect-theoretic loss aversion coefficient as a penalty calibration parameter, (b) formal mechanism design verification of auditor incentives (see Section 5.2), and (c) mathematically proven safety invariants bounding user exposure (see Section 5.4). No existing commercial platform --- DietBet, HealthyWage, Beeminder, StickK, Forfeit, or 75 Hard --- provides all three guarantees. DietBet and HealthyWage address financial stakes but lack formal safety bounds and peer audit verification. Beeminder implements escalating commitment but relies on self-reporting without independent verification. StickK introduced the anti-charity commitment concept but provides neither formal calibration nor multi-layered audit. Forfeit adds photo-based accountability but without formal theorem backing or calibrated loss aversion coefficients.

Consistent with Milkman et al.'s (2021) mega-study finding that combining multiple behavioral interventions produces significantly larger effects than any single intervention alone, Styx's integration of calibrated loss aversion, peer audit, cybernetic framework, and formal safety guarantees represents a qualitatively different approach to the commitment device design space.

## 5.2 RQ2: Fury Incentive Compatibility

**RQ2: What mechanism design properties must the Fury peer-audit network satisfy for incentive-compatible truthful reporting?**

### 5.2.1 The Honest Auditor Stability Result

The core result for RQ2 is Theorem T4 (Section 4.4), which establishes that an honest auditor whose error rate $\varepsilon \leq 0.05$ (5%) will maintain a Fury Accuracy score $FA(v) \geq 0.8$ (the demotion threshold $\underline{FA}$), and will therefore never be demoted from the auditor pool. The proof proceeds by showing that for an honest auditor with $n_v$ total audits, the accuracy score is:

$$FA(v) = \frac{a_v - \omega \cdot \bar{a}_v}{n_v}$$

where $a_v$ is successful audits, $\bar{a}_v$ is false accusations, and $\omega = 3$ is the false accusation penalty weight. For an honest auditor with error rate $\varepsilon$, we have $a_v = (1 - \varepsilon) \cdot n_v$ and $\bar{a}_v = \varepsilon \cdot n_v$, yielding $FA(v) = 1 - 4\varepsilon$. Setting $FA(v) \geq 0.8$ and solving gives $\varepsilon \leq 0.05$, confirming the theorem.

This result has immediate implications for the rational behavior of auditors. An auditor who reports honestly and whose genuine error rate is below 5% faces no risk of demotion and therefore has no incentive to deviate from truthful reporting. The $3\times$ penalty weight on false accusations ($\omega = 3$) creates an asymmetric cost structure that makes dishonest reporting --- specifically, falsely accusing users of non-compliance --- strictly dominated by honest reporting for any auditor whose true error rate is below the 5% threshold.

### 5.2.2 The $3\times$ False Accusation Weight as Mechanism Design Innovation

The choice of $\omega = 3$ as the false accusation penalty weight is a mechanism design innovation that deserves explicit discussion. In classical mechanism design, the Revelation Principle (Myerson, 2007) establishes that any mechanism achieving a desired outcome can be replaced by a direct mechanism in which truthful reporting is a dominant strategy. The challenge in peer-audit systems is that the "mechanism" is not a centralized authority but a distributed network of self-interested agents, each of whom may have incentives to report strategically.

The $3\times$ penalty weight addresses this by making the expected cost of a false accusation three times the expected benefit of a successful (but honest) audit. For an auditor considering whether to falsely accuse a user of non-compliance --- perhaps to generate additional audit fees or to harm a specific user --- the expected integrity score impact is $-\omega \cdot \beta_f = -3 \times 15 = -45$ points if the false accusation is detected, compared to $+\beta_c = +5$ points for a correct honest verdict. The cost-benefit ratio of $45/5 = 9$ far exceeds the loss aversion coefficient $\lambda = 1.955$, meaning that even a risk-seeking auditor would find false accusations prohibitively expensive.

### 5.2.3 Comparison with Existing Verification Systems

Several existing verification and arbitration systems address related incentive compatibility challenges, but each faces limitations that the Fury design explicitly avoids.

**Bayesian Truth Serum (Prelec, 2004).** The BTS mechanism elicits honest reports from agents by rewarding those whose reports are "surprisingly common" --- i.e., reported more frequently than predicted by individual prior beliefs. BTS is theoretically elegant and achieves truthful reporting as a Bayesian Nash Equilibrium, but it requires (a) a common prior among agents, (b) a well-defined signal space, and (c) a sufficient number of agents reporting on the same question. In the Fury context, conditions (a) and (b) are difficult to guarantee: auditors may have vastly different priors about what constitutes "compliance" with a given behavioral oath, and the signal space (photo/video evidence of gym attendance, dietary logs, no-contact verification) is inherently ambiguous and domain-specific. The Fury mechanism avoids these requirements by relying on outcome-based accuracy tracking rather than belief-based scoring.

**Kleros (Lesaege et al., 2019).** Kleros implements a decentralized arbitration protocol using token-staked jurors who are randomly selected and incentivized to vote with the majority via a Schelling point mechanism (Schelling, 1960). While Kleros has demonstrated practical viability for binary dispute resolution, its reliance on token staking creates a vulnerability to "whale attacks" in which a single wealthy participant acquires sufficient tokens to dominate jury selection and systematically bias outcomes. The Fury mechanism mitigates this by using integrity score rather than token holdings as the primary qualification metric; integrity score cannot be purchased and can only be accumulated through demonstrated accurate auditing over time.

**TrueBit (Teutsch & Reitwiesner, 2019).** TrueBit implements a "verification game" for off-chain computation in which verifiers are incentivized to check computations by the possibility of forced errors injected by the system. When the system detects that no verifier has challenged an incorrect computation, it injects a deliberate error to test verifier vigilance. This mechanism is structurally similar to the Styx honeypot system (Theorem T7, Section 4.7), which injects known-outcome "honeypot" cases into the audit queue to test auditor accuracy. However, TrueBit's forced errors are purely computational, while Styx's honeypots require generating plausible behavioral evidence with known compliance status --- a more complex design problem that engages the anomaly detection pipeline (Theorem T9) as well as the accuracy tracking system.

### 5.2.4 The Pincer Architecture: T4 + T7

The Fury incentive compatibility design employs what might be termed a "pincer architecture": two complementary detection mechanisms that together cover the space of possible auditor deviations. Theorem T4 provides long-run accuracy tracking, detecting auditors whose cumulative error rate exceeds the 5% threshold over a burn-in period of $\underline{n} = 10$ audits. Theorem T7 (honeypot convergence) provides point-in-time detection, catching auditors who are currently reporting dishonestly even if their cumulative record is clean. Together, these two mechanisms create a detection regime with no blind spots: T4 catches persistent low-level inaccuracy, while T7 catches sporadic or strategic dishonesty.

The honeypot system also addresses a class of attacks that pure accuracy tracking cannot detect: coordinated voting. If two or more auditors collude to submit identical verdicts regardless of evidence quality, their individual accuracy scores may remain high as long as they are correct on a sufficient fraction of non-collusive cases. However, honeypot injection disrupts coordinated voting by introducing cases where the colluding auditors must either (a) vote independently (revealing their individual assessment capacity) or (b) coordinate on a honeypot case and risk detection. The system injects honeypots at a cadence of $T_{inj} = 6$ hours with a minimum of $N_F = 3$ active Furies, making it statistically impractical for colluding auditors to avoid honeypot exposure over any extended period.

### 5.2.5 Remaining Challenges

Despite the formal guarantees, auditor collusion remains the most significant unresolved challenge for the Fury network. While random assignment and integrity-tier separation make collusion logistically difficult, the current design does not formally prove resistance to collusion among a coalition of $k > 2$ auditors who coordinate verdicts via out-of-band communication. The collusion resistance of Schelling point mechanisms has been analyzed by Buterin (2021) and others, but no general impossibility result exists for preventing all forms of collusion in peer-prediction systems without external information sources. This is an open problem in mechanism design and is flagged as a limitation in Section 5.6.

Consistent with the platform economics literature (Rochet & Tirole, 2003; Armstrong, 2006), the Fury network also faces a classic two-sided market bootstrapping problem: the network needs a critical mass of auditors to provide timely verdicts, but auditors need a sufficient volume of audit tasks to justify their participation. The $\sigma_{audit} = \$2.00$ per audit stake and the integrity score rewards provide economic incentives, but the early-stage dynamics of network growth remain an empirical question that cannot be resolved through formal analysis alone.

## 5.3 RQ3: HVCS as Design Framework

**RQ3: Can the Human Vice Control System (HVCS), a cybernetic model of competing behavioral drives, serve as a principled design framework for behavioral commitment platforms?**

### 5.3.1 The HVCS Model

The HVCS model, developed in the foundational research for this dissertation, treats human behavior as a multi-input, multi-output adaptive control system in which seven drive-nodes --- corresponding to the classical "deadly sins" reframed as behavioral subsystems --- compete for control over action selection. Each drive-node has an activation trigger, an output behavior, a cost surface, and one or more counter-regulators. The key insight is that drives do not operate in isolation: excess in one drive generates pressure that activates countervailing drives, producing a dynamic equilibrium maintained not through moral prohibition but through feedback loops.

The HVCS model draws on the cybernetic tradition inaugurated by Wiener (1948) and Ashby (1956), particularly the Conant-Ashby theorem (Conant & Ashby, 1970), which states that "every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system." Applied to behavioral commitment platforms, the Conant-Ashby theorem implies that a platform seeking to regulate user behavior must contain an internal model of the behavioral dynamics it is attempting to influence. This is a strong theoretical constraint: it means that a commitment device cannot simply impose penalties and hope for compliance; it must model the structure of the drives it is attempting to modulate.

### 5.3.2 The Seven Drives as Design Variables

In the HVCS framework, the seven drives map onto specific platform design decisions:

**Greed** (resource acquisition pressure) maps to the staking mechanism itself. The user's desire to protect their financial stake activates loss-aversive resource conservation, which the system harnesses as the primary behavioral lever. The tier system modulates the "gain" on this drive by controlling maximum stake exposure.

**Pride** (status and reputation maintenance) maps to the integrity score and its public visibility. A user whose integrity score is high is publicly recognized as trustworthy; a user whose score decays is visibly constrained. This engages the pride drive as a secondary motivator beyond the purely financial stake.

**Envy** (comparative signaling) maps to the dashboard's display of community success rates, streak lengths, and tier achievements. Consistent with Festinger's (1954) social comparison theory, surfacing these metrics activates the envy drive as a setpoint shifter, redirecting user attention toward achievable benchmarks rather than abstract goals.

**Lust** (validation-seeking and desire for reciprocity) is relevant primarily in the Recovery oath category, where no-contact contracts address the user's desire for proximity to a former partner. The HVCS framework identifies this drive as the primary antagonist in recovery contracts --- the force that must be overcome by the combined weight of loss aversion (greed for stake preservation), pride (integrity score maintenance), and the accountability partner protocol (externalized boundary enforcement).

**Wrath** (boundary enforcement) maps to the dispute resolution system (Theorem T6). When a user believes they have been wrongly penalized, the wrath drive motivates them to file a dispute. The dispute FSM channels this drive through a structured process with defined terminal states, preventing wrath from escalating into platform abandonment or external retaliation.

**Gluttony** (short-horizon gratification) is the drive that behavioral contracts are designed to counteract. Whether the target behavior is excessive eating, excessive screen time, or compulsive contact-seeking, the contract creates a financial cost surface that makes short-horizon gratification prohibitively expensive.

**Sloth** (energy conservation and damping) maps to the grace day system and the cool-off period. These mechanisms acknowledge that behavioral change requires rest and recovery, preventing the system from demanding unsustainable levels of continuous effort and thereby avoiding the burnout dynamics that destroy adherence in rigid commitment systems.

### 5.3.3 Contrast with Gamification Approaches

The HVCS framework provides a principled basis for evaluating gamification-based behavioral platforms, which represent the dominant alternative paradigm.

**Habitica** uses role-playing game mechanics (experience points, levels, equipment, party quests) to motivate habit compliance. In HVCS terms, Habitica engages the pride and envy drives through status competition but provides no activation of the greed drive (no real financial stakes) and no meaningful cost surface for failure. When a user "loses health points" in Habitica, the consequence is purely symbolic; the user can simply restart without material loss. This means Habitica operates in the gain frame exclusively, which prospect theory predicts to be approximately half as motivationally effective as loss framing per unit of incentive.

**Duolingo** uses streak mechanics, leaderboards, and social competition to drive language learning adherence. The streak system creates a sunk cost illusion --- users become reluctant to "break their streak" --- but the underlying incentive is purely psychological; abandoning a Duolingo streak incurs no financial or reputational cost beyond the user's own disappointment. In HVCS terms, Duolingo engages pride (streak maintenance) and envy (leaderboard position) but again provides no greed-drive activation. This is why Duolingo's own research reports significant long-term dropout despite high initial engagement (Linardon et al., 2020).

**Styx**, by contrast, engages all seven drives simultaneously. The financial stake activates the greed drive (loss aversion). The integrity score engages pride. The community dashboard engages envy. The Recovery oath category explicitly addresses the lust drive. The dispute system channels wrath. The contract structure counteracts gluttony. And the grace day and cool-off systems provide the damping function of sloth. This comprehensive drive engagement is not an accident of feature accumulation; it is a direct consequence of the HVCS framework's prescription that a good regulator must model all relevant subsystems of the regulated system.

### 5.3.4 The Conant-Ashby Argument

The Conant-Ashby theorem (1970) provides the strongest theoretical justification for the HVCS approach. The theorem, stated informally, holds that any system that effectively regulates another system must contain a model of that system that is isomorphic to the regulated system's relevant dynamics. Applied to behavioral commitment platforms, this means that a platform capable of sustaining behavioral change must internally represent the structure of human behavioral drives --- their interactions, their failure modes, and their feedback dynamics.

Most behavioral platforms violate the Conant-Ashby constraint implicitly. They model the user as a simple agent with a single objective (lose weight, learn a language, maintain a habit) and a single failure mode (insufficient motivation). The HVCS model recognizes that the user is a complex system with multiple competing drives, and that intervention failures typically occur not because of insufficient motivation in the abstract but because of specific, predictable interactions between drives --- the "feedback interruption failure modes" identified in the foundational research.

Six specific failure modes were identified:

1. **Greed without loss risk**: When financial incentives exist without genuine risk of forfeiture, the greed drive produces gaming behavior rather than genuine compliance. Styx addresses this through the escrow architecture (Theorem T1) and the Fury verification network (Theorem T4).

2. **Pride without reputational memory**: When reputation resets are easy or costless, the pride drive fails to stabilize behavior. Styx addresses this through the integrity score's persistent memory and its strict monotonicity properties (Theorem T3).

3. **Envy without achievable benchmarks**: When comparison targets are unrealistic, the envy drive produces despair rather than motivation. Styx addresses this through the tier system, which ensures that users are compared to peers at similar integrity levels.

4. **Wrath without structured channels**: When boundary violations have no formal resolution path, the wrath drive escalates destructively. Styx addresses this through the dispute FSM (Theorem T6).

5. **Gluttony without visible cost**: When the consequences of short-horizon gratification are delayed or hidden, the gluttony drive overrides long-term goals. Styx addresses this through immediate stake forfeiture upon verified failure.

6. **Sloth without reactivation triggers**: When rest becomes permanent disengagement, the sloth drive produces chronic stagnation. Styx addresses this through the integrity score decay ($\beta_d = 1$ per inactive month), which gently penalizes extended inactivity without punishing legitimate rest.

### 5.3.5 Limitations of the HVCS Framework

Despite its theoretical coherence, the HVCS model has a significant limitation that must be acknowledged: the seven-drive taxonomy is heuristic rather than empirically validated. While the classical "deadly sins" provide a culturally resonant framework for categorizing human drives, they do not correspond to any established factor-analytic structure in personality psychology or motivational science. The Big Five personality traits (Costa & McCrae, 1992), the Self-Determination Theory trichotomy of autonomy, competence, and relatedness (Ryan & Deci, 2000; Deci & Ryan, 1985), and the Behaviour Change Wheel's COM-B model of capability, opportunity, and motivation (Michie et al., 2011) all propose different decompositions of human motivation that are supported by substantial empirical evidence.

The HVCS model does not claim to supersede these established frameworks. Rather, it occupies a different position in the theoretical landscape: it is a systems-level design heuristic that translates well-documented drive dynamics into platform engineering decisions. Its value lies not in the precision of the seven-drive taxonomy per se, but in the cybernetic architecture that treats drives as interacting control nodes with feedback loops, cost surfaces, and failure modes. A future refinement of the HVCS model might replace the seven-drive taxonomy with a factor-analytically validated decomposition while preserving the control-theoretic architecture that is the model's primary contribution.

## 5.4 RQ4: Aegis Safety Invariants

**RQ4: What formal safety invariants (the Aegis Protocol) are necessary and sufficient to prevent iatrogenic harm in a financially-staked behavioral commitment system?**

### 5.4.1 The T5 Safety Predicate Set

Theorem T5 (Section 4.5) establishes the Aegis Safety Protocol as a conjunction of six predicates that must hold for any contract to be accepted by the system:

- *P*$_1$: $\sigma \leq \bar{\sigma}$ --- Absolute stake cap ($\bar{\sigma} = \$500$)
- *P*$_2$: $\delta \geq \underline{\delta}$ --- Minimum duration ($\underline{\delta} = 7$ days)
- *P*$_3$: $\kappa < \bar{\kappa} \lor \sigma \leq 5000$ --- Failure downscaling after 3 consecutive failures
- *P*$_4$: $IS(u) \geq 40 \lor \sigma \leq 10000$ --- Integrity-based stake cap
- *P*$_5$: $BMI(u) \geq \underline{BMI}$ --- Health floor ($\underline{BMI} = 18.5$)
- *P*$_6$: $v_w \leq \bar{v}_w$ --- Velocity cap ($\bar{v}_w = 2\%$ weekly body weight loss)

The conjunctive structure of the safety predicate set is critical: a contract is accepted if and only if all six predicates hold simultaneously. This "defense in depth" approach ensures that no single predicate failure can expose a user to harm. For example, a user with a high integrity score (*P*$_4$ satisfied) but a BMI of 17.5 (*P*$_5$ violated) would be rejected; a user with a healthy BMI but three consecutive failures (*P*$_3$ triggered) would be restricted to micro-stakes.

Predicate *P*$_1$ addresses what O'Donoghue and Rabin (1999) identified as the risk of "over-commitment" in naive agents who overestimate their future willpower. By capping absolute stake exposure at $500, the system bounds the maximum financial harm from a single contract failure, regardless of the user's confidence or integrity score. This cap was calibrated against two benchmarks: the median weekly disposable income in the target demographic and the maximum deposit amounts permitted by existing commitment device platforms (DietBet caps at approximately $500 per Transformer round; HealthyWage permits up to $1,000 per HealthyWager challenge).

Predicate *P*$_5$ --- the BMI floor of 18.5 --- directly addresses the iatrogenic risk identified by Baumeister et al. (2007) in their "strength model" of self-control: that demanding excessive self-regulation from individuals already in a depleted state can produce paradoxical harm. A BMI below 18.5 is classified as underweight by the World Health Organization and is associated with increased mortality risk, immune dysfunction, and eating disorders. Permitting a financially-staked weight loss contract for such an individual would create a perverse incentive to lose additional weight, directly contradicting the therapeutic purpose of the platform. The velocity cap *P*$_6$ provides a complementary temporal constraint, preventing unsafe rates of weight loss even for users whose starting BMI is within the healthy range.

### 5.4.2 The T8 Anti-Isolation Predicates

Theorem T8 (Section 4.8) extends the Aegis Protocol to the Recovery oath category, which introduces unique safety challenges due to the vulnerability of users in post-breakup or post-addiction states. The anti-isolation predicate set consists of five conditions:

1. Target cap: $|targets(c)| \leq \bar{n}_{NC} = 3$ (maximum no-contact targets)
2. Duration cap: $duration(c) \leq \bar{\delta}_R = 30$ days (maximum recovery contract duration)
3. Accountability partner: $AP(c) \neq \emptyset$ (mandatory external oversight)
4. Voluntariness acknowledgment: all four elements of *Ack*(*c*) must be affirmed
5. Missed attestation limit: $\chi_{miss} < \bar{\chi}_{miss} = 3$ (auto-fail after 3 missed daily attestations)

These predicates were designed with explicit reference to the clinical literature on post-breakup recovery and relapse prevention.

### 5.4.3 The 90-Day Recovery Timeline

The breakup psychology research conducted for this dissertation maps the 90-day post-breakup recovery timeline onto specific vulnerability windows that directly informed the T8 predicate design. The research identifies three primary danger zones:

**Days 3-5 (Acute Panic Phase):** The collapse of denial triggers massive cortisol release and amygdala hijack. The user experiences intense, impulsive urges to contact the former partner --- not for meaningful communication but simply to verify that the attachment figure still exists and is accessible. This window corresponds to the "extinction burst" phenomenon in behavioral psychology, where the temporary intensification of an extinguishing behavior precedes its eventual cessation (Marlatt & Donovan, 2005).

**Weekends (Friday and Saturday nights):** The loss of weekday cognitive load activates the Default Mode Network (DMN), producing severe rumination and social isolation. The combination of reduced prefrontal inhibition and culturally saturated expectations of romantic partnership creates a high-risk window for relapse, particularly when compounded by alcohol consumption.

**Days 45-60 (Bargaining Phase):** The partial recovery of dopamine baseline creates an "illusion of strength" in which the user convinces themselves that they have completed sufficient emotional processing to re-engage with the former partner as a friend. This phase is characterized by highly premeditated relapse attempts disguised as mature, rational communication.

The T8 predicates address these vulnerability windows through multiple mechanisms. The 30-day duration cap prevents contracts from extending through the entire 90-day recovery window, forcing users to make conscious re-commitment decisions at the end of each period. The mandatory accountability partner provides external boundary enforcement during the acute panic phase, when the user's own prefrontal cortex is functionally offline. The daily attestation requirement with auto-fail after three misses creates a lightweight check-in mechanism that detects disengagement before it escalates to relapse.

### 5.4.4 The 7-Day Cool-Off and Grill Me AI Screening

The first 7-14 days post-breakup represent the highest-risk window for what might be termed "revenge staking" --- the creation of a recovery contract motivated not by genuine desire for behavioral change but by anger, spite, or emotional dysregulation. A user in the acute panic phase might create a no-contact contract with an excessively high stake, targeting their former partner, with the unconscious intention of using the financial penalty as a mechanism for self-punishment or as a dramatic gesture of commitment.

The 7-day cool-off period ($\tau_{cool}$) addresses this by preventing contract creation immediately after a prior contract failure. The Grill Me AI screening (powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash) provides an additional layer of cognitive friction: before a recovery contract is accepted, the user is subjected to a structured interview that probes their motivations, emotional state, and understanding of the contract's implications. This screening is not designed to replace clinical assessment but to create a "speed bump" that forces the user to engage their prefrontal cortex and articulate rational reasons for the contract, countering the amygdala-driven impulsivity that characterizes the acute post-breakup phase.

### 5.4.5 Complementarity of T5 and T8

Theorems T5 and T8 address different phases of the user lifecycle. T5 governs contract creation safety for all oath categories, ensuring that no contract exposes a user to excessive financial risk, unsafe health practices, or unsupervised behavioral pressure. T8 adds specific protections for recovery contracts, addressing the unique vulnerabilities of users in post-breakup, post-addiction, or other recovery states.

The complementarity is by design. A user creating a Biological oath category contract (e.g., "maintain gym attendance 4x/week for 30 days") is protected by T5's stake cap, duration minimum, failure downscaling, integrity-based limit, BMI floor, and velocity cap. A user creating a Recovery oath category contract (e.g., "maintain no contact with former partner for 30 days") is protected by all of T5's predicates plus T8's target cap, duration limit, accountability partner requirement, voluntariness check, and attestation monitoring. The nested structure ensures that recovery contracts receive strictly more protection than standard contracts, reflecting their higher risk profile.

### 5.4.6 The Autonomy-Paternalism Tension

A philosophical tension runs through the Aegis Protocol: between user autonomy (the right of an informed adult to accept financial risk in pursuit of behavioral goals) and platform paternalism (the obligation of the system to prevent users from harming themselves). This tension is particularly acute in the Recovery oath category, where users are by definition in emotionally compromised states that impair their capacity for rational risk assessment.

The Aegis Protocol resolves this tension through a principle that might be termed "calibrated paternalism": the system does not prohibit risky contracts outright but constrains the parameter space within which users can operate. A user can create a no-contact contract, but only with at most 3 targets, for at most 30 days, with a mandatory accountability partner, and after affirming all four voluntariness acknowledgments. These constraints reduce the risk of iatrogenic harm without eliminating user agency --- a design philosophy consistent with Thaler and Sunstein's (2008) "libertarian paternalism" framework and with the broader commitment device literature that recognizes the value of voluntarily constraining one's future choices (Bryan et al., 2010).

The design also responds to the concern raised by Halpern et al. (2019) that financial incentives for health behavior can create perverse incentives if not carefully bounded. By ensuring that stakes are always proportional to the user's demonstrated behavioral capacity (via the integrity-based cap *P*$_4$), the system prevents the scenario in which a novice user stakes a large sum, fails, suffers financial harm, and abandons the platform --- precisely the outcome that maximizes iatrogenic risk and minimizes therapeutic benefit.

## 5.5 RQ5: Legal Classification

**RQ5: How does the legal classification of financially-staked behavioral contracts map onto the skill-chance spectrum under United States gambling law?**

### 5.5.1 The Three-Part Legal Test Framework

United States gambling law does not provide a single, unified standard for determining whether a given activity constitutes illegal gambling. Instead, the legal landscape is fragmented across federal and state jurisdictions, with three principal tests used to evaluate whether an activity falls on the "skill" or "chance" side of the spectrum:

**The Predominant Purpose Test (Dominant Factor Test).** Applied in the majority of states, this test asks whether skill predominates over chance as the determining factor in the outcome. Under this standard, an activity is not gambling if the participant's skill, effort, and strategy are the primary determinants of success or failure, even if some element of chance is present (Braslow Legal, 2020; Klein Moynihan Turco, 2020). The recent constitutional jurisprudence on daily fantasy sports (DFS) --- particularly the New York Court of Appeals decision upholding the Interactive Fantasy Sports Law (Gibson Dunn, 2026; Blank Rome, 2020) --- provides strong precedent that activities requiring sustained analytical effort and strategic decision-making satisfy this test even when random elements (injuries, weather, referee decisions) introduce irreducible uncertainty.

**The Material Element Test.** Applied in some states, this test asks whether chance plays a "material," "significant," or "consequential" role in determining the outcome, regardless of whether skill is the predominant factor. This is a more stringent standard: an activity that is 70% skill-determined and 30% chance-determined would pass the Predominant Purpose Test but might fail the Material Element Test if the 30% chance component is deemed "material."

**The Any-Chance Test.** Applied in a small number of strict jurisdictions, this test holds that the presence of any element of chance, however slight, renders the activity an illegal lottery or gambling operation. Under this standard, virtually all activities involving real-world outcomes are at risk of classification as gambling, since even the most skill-dependent activities (surgery, athletic performance, academic examination) involve some irreducible chance component.

### 5.5.2 Why Styx Contracts Satisfy the Predominant Purpose Test

Styx behavioral contracts satisfy the Predominant Purpose Test on multiple grounds. First, and most fundamentally, Styx contracts involve the user wagering on their own behavior --- an activity over which the user has substantially complete control. Unlike DFS (where the user's outcome depends on the statistical performance of third-party athletes), sports betting (where the outcome is entirely determined by external events), or casino games (where the outcome is determined by random number generation), a Styx contract's outcome is determined primarily by whether the user performs the committed behavior: attending the gym, maintaining a diet, abstaining from contact with a former partner.

Second, Styx contracts do not involve wagering against other users. The user's stake is held in FBO escrow (Theorem T1) and is returned in full upon successful completion. There is no "house edge," no pool from which winners are paid, and no scenario in which one user's success depends on another user's failure. This distinguishes Styx from DietBet (where successful participants share a pool funded by unsuccessful participants) and from prediction markets (where participants take opposite positions on an outcome).

Third, the outcome of a Styx contract is verifiable through the Fury peer-audit network (Theorem T4) and hardware oracle attestation, not through random number generation or external event observation. The verification mechanism confirms whether the user performed the committed behavior, not whether a random or external event occurred. This maps the activity squarely onto the "skill" side of the skill-chance spectrum, consistent with the HealthyWage legal analysis that identifies personal weight management as a "skill-based contest" (HealthyWage, 2026).

### 5.5.3 The UIGEA Fantasy Sports Precedent

The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (UIGEA, 31 U.S.C. ss 5361-5367) provides an important legislative precedent. UIGEA prohibits the processing of financial transactions for "unlawful internet gambling" but explicitly exempts "fantasy or simulation sports games" that meet certain criteria, including: (a) the outcomes are determined predominantly by the accumulated statistical performance of individuals in real-world events; (b) winning is not based on the score or point spread of any single real-world team or combination of teams; and (c) prizes are established in advance and not determined by the number of participants (31 U.S.C. s 5362(1)(E)(ix)).

The UIGEA exemption for fantasy sports establishes a legislative recognition that activities requiring sustained skill, effort, and analysis --- even when involving real-world uncertainty --- can be distinguished from gambling. Styx contracts present a stronger case than DFS for skill classification: a user's control over their own behavioral outcomes (gym attendance, dietary compliance, no-contact maintenance) is substantially greater than a DFS player's control over the statistical performance of third-party professional athletes. If DFS passes the UIGEA skill test, behavioral commitment contracts should pass a fortiori.

### 5.5.4 State-by-State Regulatory Matrix

The fragmented state-by-state regulatory landscape creates a complex compliance matrix for Styx. Based on the legal analysis conducted for this dissertation, states can be classified into three categories:

**Green (clearly legal):** States applying the Predominant Purpose Test, where skill-based contests are explicitly permitted and the user's control over their own behavioral outcomes places Styx contracts well within the "skill" designation. This includes the majority of states, including California, New York (post-DFS constitutional ruling), Texas, Illinois, and Florida.

**Yellow (uncertain):** States applying the Material Element Test, where the question of whether metabolic variance, sudden illness, or other uncontrollable factors constitute a "material" chance element remains unresolved. This includes states with active litigation around DFS or evolving gambling law frameworks.

**Red (likely prohibited):** States applying the Any-Chance Test, where the presence of any uncontrollable factor (illness, injury, metabolic variation) could render behavioral commitment contracts illegal. These states --- historically including Arizona (prior to 2021 reforms) and a small number of others --- require either geographic exclusion or the implementation of Alternative Methods of Entry (AMOE) to remove the "consideration" element of the gambling triad.

### 5.5.5 Stripe FBO Structure as Regulatory Architecture

The financial architecture of Styx is designed to avoid triggering money transmission licensing requirements. By routing all user funds through Stripe Connect's For Benefit Of (FBO) account structure, Styx ensures that user deposits are held by a chartered banking institution (Stripe's banking partner) rather than by the platform itself. This means Styx never takes legal title to user funds, never commingles user deposits with operating capital, and never functions as a "money transmitter" under state or federal definitions (Modern Treasury, 2026).

This FBO structure also addresses the "consideration" element of the three-part gambling definition (consideration, chance, prize). Because the user's deposit is held in escrow and returned in full upon successful completion --- rather than pooled with other users' deposits and redistributed based on relative performance --- the transaction resembles a conditional deposit or performance bond rather than a wager. The user is not "paying to play" in the gambling sense; they are depositing funds that they will recover if they perform the committed behavior.

### 5.5.6 Linguistic Cloaking as Compliance Strategy

Styx implements a "linguistic cloaker" (src/web/utils/linguistic-cloak.ts) that systematically replaces Stygian terminology with neutral alternatives in production builds: "stake" becomes "vault deposit," "bet" becomes "commitment," "Fury" becomes "peer reviewer." This is complemented by a gatekeeper scan (scripts/gatekeeper-scan.sh) that CI pipeline validation gate 04 (scripts/validation/04-redacted-build-check.sh) enforces to ensure that no gambling-adjacent terminology appears in production builds.

This linguistic strategy is not merely cosmetic. App Store review processes (Apple App Store Guidelines, Section 5.3; Google Play Developer Policy, Section 4.4) explicitly prohibit applications that facilitate gambling unless they hold appropriate licenses. Payment processor terms of service (Stripe Terms, Section 3.3) similarly restrict accounts engaged in gambling-related activities. By maintaining a clean separation between internal development terminology (which uses evocative Stygian language for team communication and brand identity) and production-facing terminology (which uses neutral commitment-device language), Styx avoids triggering automated content screening that could result in app rejection or payment processing suspension.

### 5.5.7 Aegis as Preemptive Regulatory Compliance

The Aegis Protocol (Theorem T5) serves a dual purpose: it protects users from iatrogenic harm and it addresses Federal Trade Commission (FTC) consumer protection requirements. Specifically:

- The BMI floor (*P*$_5$) and velocity cap (*P*$_6$) demonstrate that the platform does not incentivize unsafe weight loss practices, addressing the FTC's "Gut Check" guidelines for weight loss advertising claims (FTC, 2023).
- The stake cap (*P*$_1$) and failure downscaling (*P*$_3$) demonstrate that the platform bounds maximum consumer financial exposure, addressing the FTC's concerns about deceptive practices in financial incentive programs.
- The integrity-based cap (*P*$_4$) demonstrates that financial exposure is proportional to the user's demonstrated behavioral capacity, addressing the FTC's guidance on responsible advertising of expected results.

These safety invariants, being formally proven rather than merely policy-stated, provide a level of regulatory defensibility that exceeds the informal "best practices" of competitor platforms. If challenged by a regulatory authority, Styx can point to mathematical proofs that its safety constraints are logically consistent, computationally enforceable, and provably sufficient to prevent the specific harms (excessive financial loss, unsafe health practices, exploitative contract terms) that regulators are most likely to scrutinize.

## 5.6 Limitations

This research, despite its comprehensive formal treatment, is subject to several significant limitations that must be explicitly acknowledged.

### 5.6.1 Absence of Live User Data

The most fundamental limitation is that all results in this dissertation are theoretical, architectural, and prototype-based. No randomized controlled trial (RCT) has been conducted. No live user data has been collected. No behavioral outcomes have been measured in a production environment. The formal proofs establish that the system's algorithms satisfy their specified properties, but they do not establish that those properties, when instantiated in a production system with real users, will produce the predicted behavioral outcomes. The gap between formal correctness and empirical effectiveness is well-documented in the design science research methodology (Hevner et al., 2004; Peffers et al., 2007) and cannot be bridged by theoretical analysis alone.

This limitation is particularly acute for the loss aversion claims (RQ1). While the $\lambda = 1.955$ coefficient is drawn from empirical research, the translation from a laboratory-measured cognitive bias to a platform-level behavioral intervention involves multiple assumptions that have not been empirically validated: that the coefficient applies uniformly across the Styx user demographic, that financial stakes of the magnitudes permitted by the tier system are sufficient to activate loss-aversive responses, and that the temporal structure of contract durations aligns with the time horizons over which loss aversion is empirically observed. Each of these assumptions is plausible but untested.

### 5.6.2 Regulatory Uncertainty

The legal analysis (RQ5) identifies a favorable regulatory position under the Predominant Purpose Test but cannot provide a definitive legal determination. State gambling law varies significantly across jurisdictions, and no court has specifically addressed the legal classification of peer-audited, financially-staked behavioral commitment contracts. The precedent from DFS litigation is favorable but not dispositive; a regulatory authority or court might distinguish behavioral commitment contracts from DFS on grounds not anticipated by this analysis. Furthermore, the regulatory landscape for fintech applications is evolving rapidly, with the CFTC's ongoing rulemaking on event contracts and prediction markets (CFTC, 2024) potentially creating new compliance obligations for platforms that handle conditional financial deposits.

### 5.6.3 Scalability Constraints

Several components of the Styx architecture face scalability limitations that would require engineering solutions before production deployment. The pHash duplicate detection system (Theorem T9) currently performs linear scans over the proof database, yielding $O(n)$ complexity per new proof submission; at scale, this would require indexing structures such as locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) or approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms. The Fury assignment system distributes audit tasks via a single BullMQ instance, creating a bottleneck that would require horizontal scaling (multiple Redis instances or a distributed task queue) for high-volume deployments. The integrity score computation is performed synchronously during contract creation, adding latency that would become problematic under concurrent load.

### 5.6.4 Native Bridge Dependencies

The mobile application's sensor verification capabilities (HealthKit integration for biometric data, Google Fit for activity data, Screen Time API for device usage) exist only as architectural stubs. The actual native bridges require platform-specific implementations in Swift (iOS) and Kotlin (Android) that have not been developed. Until these bridges are implemented, hardware oracle verification (a key component of the proof submission pipeline) cannot be tested in production conditions. This limitation affects the practical viability of Biological and Cognitive oath category contracts, which depend on device-level sensor data for compliance verification.

### 5.6.5 AI-Generated Proof Detection

The current design does not address the adversarial threat of AI-generated proof submissions. As generative AI models (GPT-4V, Gemini, Stable Diffusion, etc.) become increasingly capable of producing photorealistic images and videos, the risk of users submitting synthetic proof of behavioral compliance --- an AI-generated image of a gym check-in, a deepfake video of a weigh-in --- will grow. Theorem T9's pHash soundness bounds apply to perceptual hashing of genuine photographic content; they do not address the detection of AI-generated content that is semantically plausible but factually fabricated. This is flagged as a critical future work item (Section 5.7).

### 5.6.6 pHash Stub Limitation

Theorem T9 establishes formal bounds on the false positive rate of perceptual hash-based duplicate detection, but these bounds assume a production-grade pHash implementation. The current codebase contains a stub implementation that returns predetermined values for testing purposes. While the formal bounds are mathematically correct, their practical applicability depends on the eventual deployment of a production pHash library (such as phash.org's reference implementation) with empirically validated collision properties.

### 5.6.7 Crowding-Out Risk

Despite the calibration of financial incentives against the loss aversion coefficient, the crowding-out effect identified by Gneezy and Rustichini (2000) and extensively discussed in the Self-Determination Theory literature (Ryan & Deci, 2000; Deci & Ryan, 1985) remains a potential concern. The introduction of external financial stakes may, for some users, reduce intrinsic motivation for the underlying behavior --- transforming "I want to exercise because it makes me feel good" into "I exercise because I will lose money if I don't." If this transformation occurs, the long-term sustainability of behavioral change after the contract period ends may be compromised. The tier system's graduated exposure mitigates this risk by starting users at low stake levels, but empirical validation is needed to determine whether the crowding-out effect operates at the stake magnitudes and demographic profiles relevant to the Styx platform.

### 5.6.8 Selection Bias

The Styx platform, by its nature, is likely to attract users who are already predisposed to loss aversion and who already desire behavioral change --- a form of selection bias that would confound any attempt to measure the platform's causal effect on behavior. Users who are indifferent to financial losses, who do not experience loss aversion at population-average levels, or who are not motivated to change their behavior would be unlikely to adopt the platform in the first place. Any observed behavioral effects in a deployed system would therefore reflect the joint effect of the platform's mechanisms and the self-selected characteristics of its user base, making it difficult to isolate the platform's independent contribution.

### 5.6.9 HVCS Validation Gap

As discussed in Section 5.3.5, the seven-drive taxonomy underlying the HVCS model is theoretically motivated by cybernetic principles and the classical vice framework but has not been subjected to empirical factor analysis. While the model provides a coherent design heuristic, its claim to be a "principled" design framework rests on theoretical rather than empirical foundations. A factor-analytic study validating (or revising) the seven-drive decomposition would significantly strengthen the HVCS contribution.

---

## 5.7 Future Work

### 5.7.1 Randomized Controlled Trial Design

The most important next step is the design and execution of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to empirically validate the behavioral predictions of the Styx framework. The proposed design involves:

- **Participants:** 200-400 adults (age 18-65) recruited through digital advertising, stratified by gender, age bracket, and baseline loss aversion (measured via a validated loss aversion scale).
- **Conditions:** (a) Styx platform with financial stakes (treatment); (b) identical platform without financial stakes (active control); (c) waitlist control.
- **Outcome measures:** primary --- behavioral adherence rate at 30, 60, and 90 days; secondary --- integrity score trajectory, tier progression, Fury audit accuracy, self-reported motivation and well-being.
- **Follow-up:** 90 days post-contract completion, measuring behavioral maintenance in the absence of financial stakes.
- **IRB approval:** required, with specific attention to the ethical implications of financial stakes in behavioral interventions and the informed consent process for recovery-category contracts.

The trial should be pre-registered and powered to detect a medium effect size (Cohen's *d* = 0.5) at 80% power with $\alpha = 0.05$, consistent with the effect sizes reported in the contingency management literature (Stitzer & Petry, 2018; Volpp et al., 2009).

### 5.7.2 On-Chain Migration

The current Styx implementation uses a PostgreSQL-based double-entry ledger (Theorem T1) and a SHA-256 hash-chained truth log (Theorem T2) as centralized equivalents of blockchain data structures. A natural evolution would be to migrate the truth log to a Layer 2 rollup (Optimism, Arbitrum, or a purpose-built rollup) for true decentralization. This migration would replace the centralized trust assumption (that the Styx operator maintains the integrity of the truth log) with a cryptographic guarantee backed by Ethereum's consensus mechanism. The ledger invariant (Theorem T1) and tamper evidence property (Theorem T2) would be preserved by construction, as the rollup inherits the security properties of the underlying L1 chain.

### 5.7.3 Federated Fury Networks

The current Fury network operates as a single global pool of auditors. A federated extension would permit organizations --- employer wellness programs, clinical research institutions, addiction treatment centers --- to operate their own audit networks with organization-specific policies while connecting to the broader Styx ecosystem for cross-network reputation portability. This "federated Fury" architecture would address the B2B expansion opportunity identified in the market analysis, enabling enterprise HR dashboards that allow employers to create team behavioral contracts with organizational audit oversight.

### 5.7.4 B2B Enterprise Expansion

The B2B opportunity --- enterprise wellness programs that use financially-staked behavioral contracts as employee benefit instruments --- requires careful legal structuring to avoid CFTC classification as an event contract (see Section 5.5). The key structural requirement is that employer-funded rewards (not employee-funded stakes) provide the financial incentive, transforming the mechanism from a "deposit contract" to a "performance bonus." This restructuring preserves the loss-aversive framing (employees lose the opportunity to earn the bonus if they fail to comply) while avoiding the "consideration" element that triggers gambling classification. Consistent with Christensen et al.'s (2009) disruption framework, the B2B channel also provides a lower-risk market entry point with institutional customers who can absorb the regulatory complexity.

### 5.7.5 AI Adversarial Defense

The emerging threat of AI-generated proof submissions requires a multi-layered detection strategy. Three complementary approaches are proposed:

1. **GAN discriminator integration:** Train a binary classifier on real and AI-generated images of common proof types (gym selfies, scale readouts, meal photographs) and integrate it into the proof submission pipeline as a pre-screening filter.
2. **C2PA hardware attestation:** Require proof images to carry Content Credentials (C2PA 1.4 specification) attesting to their capture by a genuine camera sensor, verified against a trust list of known device manufacturers (C2PA, 2024; World Privacy Forum, 2024).
3. **Temporal consistency analysis:** Compare submitted proof images against the user's historical submission patterns (location metadata, device fingerprint, lighting conditions, background elements) to detect anomalous submissions that may indicate synthetic generation.

### 5.7.6 International Expansion

The current legal analysis is limited to United States jurisdictions. International expansion would require regulatory analysis across multiple frameworks: the European Union's evolving AI Act and Digital Services Act, the United Kingdom's Gambling Commission oversight, and jurisdiction-specific gambling and fintech regulations in target markets. Non-USD currency support would require integration with multi-currency payment processors and attention to exchange rate risk in escrow holdings.

### 5.7.7 Longitudinal Retention Study

The market analysis identifies a catastrophic baseline retention rate of 3.9% at 15 days and 3.3% at 30 days for mental health and wellness applications (Adjust, 2023; Linardon et al., 2020). A longitudinal study comparing Styx retention rates against these baselines over a 1-year period would provide critical evidence for the platform's value proposition. The study should measure not only raw retention but also behavioral outcome quality (whether retained users are actually achieving their committed goals) and financial outcome quality (whether users perceive the financial stakes as fair, proportionate, and therapeutically beneficial). Consistent with Difrancesco et al.'s (2023) finding that long-term adherence requires sustained engagement rather than initial enrollment, the study should track engagement patterns across the full 12-month period rather than focusing exclusively on early-stage retention.

### 5.7.8 Personalized Loss Aversion Coefficients

The current system uses a population-average loss aversion coefficient ($\lambda = 1.955$) for all users. A natural refinement would be to estimate individual-level loss aversion coefficients from user behavior data --- staking patterns, contract completion rates, response to near-miss scenarios --- and use these personalized coefficients to calibrate stake recommendations. Machine learning models (gradient-boosted trees or neural networks trained on behavioral features) could predict individual $\lambda$ values and recommend stake amounts that maximize behavioral deterrence while minimizing financial risk. This personalization would address the heterogeneity in loss aversion documented by Benartzi and Thaler (1995), who found significant individual variation around the population mean. However, this approach introduces its own ethical considerations: a system that identifies users with exceptionally high loss aversion and recommends correspondingly high stakes could be perceived as exploitative, requiring careful calibration against the Aegis safety predicates.

## Chapter Summary

This chapter has interpreted the nine formal theorems established in Chapter 4 through the lens of the five research questions motivating this dissertation. The discussion reveals that Styx occupies a unique position in the behavioral commitment device landscape: it is the first system to combine prospect-theoretic calibration of financial stakes ($\lambda = 1.955$ as penalty coefficient), formally verified peer-audit incentive compatibility (the Fury $3\times$ false accusation weight and honeypot convergence), a cybernetic design framework (HVCS) that provides principled guidance for which behavioral levers to activate, mathematically proven safety invariants (Aegis Protocol) that bound iatrogenic risk, and a legal classification strategy grounded in the skill-chance spectrum analysis.

The limitations of this work are significant and should not be understated: the absence of live user data, the unresolved regulatory uncertainty, the scalability constraints of the current prototype, the native bridge dependencies, and the untested HVCS taxonomy all represent genuine barriers between the formal framework presented here and a production-ready behavioral commitment platform. The future work program --- particularly the RCT, the AI adversarial defense, and the personalized loss aversion calibration --- addresses the most critical of these gaps.

What the formal results do establish, however, is that a rigorous theoretical foundation for financially-staked behavioral commitment is both possible and productive. The theorems are not merely mathematical exercises; they translate directly into system invariants that can be computationally enforced, compliance arguments that can be presented to regulators, and design principles that can guide engineering decisions. In this sense, the Styx framework demonstrates that the intersection of prospect theory, mechanism design, cybernetics, and formal verification can yield a coherent, defensible, and ethically grounded approach to one of the oldest problems in behavioral science: how to help people do what they already know they should do, but cannot bring themselves to do on their own.
