## Abstract

The digital health and wellness application market, valued at $7.48 billion in 2024 and projected to reach $17.52 billion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate of 14.6%, suffers from a catastrophic retention crisis that undermines its core therapeutic promise. Comprehensive mobile attribution benchmarks reveal a median 15-day retention rate of just 3.9% for mental health applications, with over 80% of users abandoning these platforms between days 1 and 10. By day 30, only 3.3% of the initial user cohort remains engaged. This mass attrition is not a marketing failure but a structural deficiency in the prevailing product model, which relies almost exclusively on intrinsic motivation, passive tracking, and low-consequence nudges. When the psychological difficulty of sustaining behavioral change exceeds a user's baseline motivation, existing platforms provide no external consequence density to bridge the gap.

This dissertation presents the design, formalization, and prototype evaluation of Styx, a peer-audited behavioral market that addresses this structural gap through financially-staked commitment devices grounded in prospect theory. The system operationalizes loss aversion (lambda = 1.955) as a negative-feedback controller within a novel cybernetic framework, the Human Vice Control System (HVCS), which models seven behavioral drive categories---Biological, Cognitive, Professional, Creative, Environmental, Character, and Recovery---as interacting control nodes subject to cross-constraint and feedback regulation. Styx functions as the exogenous negative-feedback controller that existing intrinsic-motivation platforms lack, introducing real financial consequence at the precise moment users are most vulnerable to abandonment.

The research follows a Design Science Research (DSR) methodology, producing both a formal theoretical contribution and a working prototype. Nine formal theorems are stated and proved, establishing: (T1) a double-entry ledger balance invariant guaranteeing conservation of stake; (T2) SHA-256 hash-chained tamper evidence for the truth log; (T3) boundedness and monotonic tier progression of integrity scores; (T4) honest auditor dominance as a weakly dominant strategy in the Fury peer-audit network; (T5) Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) safety guarantees for the Aegis harm-prevention protocol; (T6) termination and determinism of the dispute resolution finite state machine; (T7) a lower bound on honeypot convergence ensuring dishonest auditor detection; (T8) an anti-isolation guarantee for recovery contracts preventing iatrogenic social harm; and (T9) soundness of perceptual hash duplicate detection with bounded false positive rates.

The prototype instantiation comprises 467 automated tests across six workspaces (NestJS API, Next.js web dashboard, React Native mobile client, Tauri desktop application, shared type library, and interactive pitch deck), a PostgreSQL double-entry ledger, Redis-backed BullMQ task queues, Stripe FBO escrow integration, and Cloudflare R2 zero-egress media storage. Eight validation gates enforce the formal invariants at the continuous integration layer.

This work contributes the first system that simultaneously combines prospect-theoretic financial stakes, mechanism-design-informed peer audit, and cybernetic drive modeling with formally proved safety guarantees. The HVCS framework offers a novel theoretical lens for behavioral intervention design, while the nine theorems provide a reusable formal foundation for future financially-staked accountability platforms.
