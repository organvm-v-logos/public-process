# Build

# Collections — essays as first-class content
# Dual-directory pattern:
#   _posts/  = All 42 essays in blog-post format (powers the feed, index, date-sorted listings)
#   essays/  = 16 flagship long-form essays organized by category (meta-system/, subsidiary/)
#              These are the Jekyll collection items that get their own permalink pages.
# Both directories are active and intentional. _posts/ is the complete corpus; essays/ is the curated showcase.
