## How to Contribute

- Include clear reproduction steps for bugs
- For documentation issues, specify which file and section

### Making Changes

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub
2. **Clone** your fork locally
3. **Create a branch** for your change:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```
4. **Make your changes** following the code style guidelines below
5. **Test** your changes:
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll build --strict_front_matter

### Code Style

Essays use Markdown with YAML frontmatter (title, date, categories, tags, excerpt). Follow the existing essay style: clear prose, specific examples, honest reflection. Filenames follow Jekyll convention: YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md in _posts/.

### Commit Messages

- Use imperative mood: "add feature" not "added feature"
- Keep the title under 72 characters
- Reference issue numbers when applicable: "fix auth bug (#42)"
- Keep commits atomic and focused on a single change

## Pull Request Process

1. Fill out the PR template with a description of your changes
2. Reference any related issues
3. Ensure all CI checks pass
4. Request review from a maintainer
5. Address review feedback promptly

PRs should be focused — one feature or fix per PR. Large changes should be
discussed in an issue first.
